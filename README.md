# BugZillaAgeingTool

Let me present you a new monitoring tool for our  projects.  We call it Bugzilla ageing monitoring tool. 
Please find the frequently asked questions below . I hope it covers everything related to the tool .
So what is it? 
 
 
Let me explain that. Bugzilla bug ageing monitoring tool is an extended version of Bugzilla to overcome the limitation of custom requirement required by any critical projects. This tool will help to identify any bugs lagging  for a long time based on custom rules set by project leads.
 
 

So how do we know the age of the Bug ?
 
 
Well if any assigned bug is not resolved within two days then it will turn to yellow color and eventually become red when it crosses the 5 days max limit. 
Is it real-time or need to refresh every time?
 
 
Yes, it is real time. No need to refresh the page.  Any update is done in Bugzilla, say the status changed from to Assigned to resolved,  it will automatically update our app with proper data .
 
 

What about the security?
 
 
This application works with Bugzilla authentication. That means the user must have Bugzilla access.

What I will get apart from bug ageing info .

 
 
 Apart from bugs ageing information , the tool  has options to display  "Todays' Production Tickets" ,"Todays' UAT bugs  "Todays' Production support bugs " . So you no need to actually wait for your QA to send a list of bugs report  every day . Information will be available anytime you request .
